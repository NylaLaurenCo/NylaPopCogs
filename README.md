Updated version of https://github.com/NekoTony/Neko-Cogs account cog
I couldn't find that person's discord tag, so couldn't ask him before uploading, but my discord's DMs are open.

# Leveler
Require Pillow 5.3.0 (pip3 install Pillow==5.3.0)
Apparently the cog isn't working on latest version of Pillow, no idea why

The first Leveler cog made for v3 !
Inspired by Stevy's v2 Leveler
Basic code made by myself, TrustyJaid helped a lot making things look awesome (he entirely made the [p]profile image, big thumbs up to him)
Just use [p]set locale fr-FR if you want to translate the cog into french !
NB: channel whitelist is enabled by default, if you want people to get xp from all your channels, just use [p]levelerset channel whitelist toggle
NB2: you can customize your profile using profileset !
